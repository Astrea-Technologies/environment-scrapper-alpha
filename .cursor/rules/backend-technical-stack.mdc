## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Pattern

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
Client Request → API Layer → Service Layer → Repository Layer → Database
                                          ↑
                                     Schema Layer
```

### 2.2 Key Components

- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses, input validation, and routing
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates repositories
- **Repository Layer**: Provides data access patterns and database operations
- **Schema Layer**: Defines data contracts for API input/output
- **Model Layer**: Defines database models and relationships

### 2.3 Directory Structure

```

## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 Hybrid Database Technology

The application employs a hybrid database architecture to address the diverse data requirements of political social media analysis:

| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose | MVP Status |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| Relational Database | PostgreSQL | 13+ | Entity data and relationships | ✅ Included |
| Document Database | MongoDB | 6.0+ | Social media content and engagement | ✅ Included |
| In-memory Database | Redis | 7.0+ | Caching and real-time operations | ❌ **NOT in MVP** |
| Vector Database | Pinecone | Latest | Semantic similarity analysis | ✅ Included |

Refer to `database-architecture.md` for detailed implementation specifications.

### 3.2 Primary Domain Models

- **User**: Authentication and user profile data
- **PoliticalEntity**: Political figures, organizations, and campaigns
- **SocialMediaAccount**: Platform account connections 
- **EntityRelationship**: Relationships between political entities

### 3.3 Key Design Decisions

- **UUID Primary Keys**: All entities use UUID primary keys for security and distributed system compatibility
- **Cross-database References**: Consistent reference patterns between databases
- **Relationship Management**: Proper foreign key constraints with cascade delete
- **String Field Constraints**: Appropriate length limits on all VARCHAR fields
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic for version-controlled schema changes

### 3.4 Additional Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose | MVP Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| motor | 3.2.0+ | Async MongoDB driver | ✅ Included |
| redis | 4.6.0+ | Redis client | ❌ **NOT in MVP** |
| pinecone-client | 2.2.1+ | Pinecone Vector DB client | ✅ Included |
| pymongo | 4.5.0+ | MongoDB client | ✅ Included |

Refer to `data-processing-architecture.md` for details on processing pipelines and analysis components.

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 API Structure

- RESTful API design principles
- Resource-based URL structure
- Version prefixing (`/api/v1/...`)
- OpenAPI documentation

### 4.2 Response Format

All API responses follow a standardized format:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },          // Actual response payload
  "success": true,          // Success indicator
  "message": "Description"  // Human-readable message
}
```

Error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": { ... }        // Additional error details
}
```

### 4.3 Authentication

- JWT token-based authentication
- OAuth2 password flow with Bearer token
- Role-based access control (standard user vs superuser)

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Database Optimization

- Efficient query patterns via repositories
- Appropriate indexing of frequently queried fields
- Pagination for list endpoints

### 5.2 API Performance

- Async/await support for I/O bound operations
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Request validation at the edge

## 6. Security Features

### 6.1 Authentication & Authorization

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with appropriate expiration
- Principle of least privilege in endpoint permissions

### 6.2 Data Protection

- Input validation using Pydantic
- CORS protection
- Email-based password recovery flow

## 7. Development Workflow

### 7.1 Environment Setup

- Containerized development with Docker
- Environment-specific configuration
- Virtual environment management with uv

### 7.2 Quality Assurance

- Type checking with mypy
- Linting with ruff
- Automated testing with pytest
- Pre-commit hooks

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### 8.1 Containerization

- Docker-based deployment
- Multi-stage build for optimized image size
- Environment variable configuration

### 8.2 Monitoring

- Sentry integration for error tracking
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging

## 9. Scalability Considerations

### 9.1 Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless API design
- Database connection pooling
- External state management

### 9.2 Future Extensibility

- Modular service architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Version-prefixed API endpoints

## 10. Task Processing System (MVP)

### 10.1 MVP Implementation

The MVP version uses a simplified approach for task processing:

- **TaskManager**: In-memory task management system
- **FastAPI BackgroundTasks**: Used for asynchronous execution
- **Task Status Tracking**: Maintains task state (pending, running, completed, failed)
- **Simple API**: Endpoints for task creation, status checking, and listing

### 10.2 MVP Limitations

- **No Persistent Storage**: Tasks stored in memory only, lost on server restart
- **No Distributed Processing**: All tasks run on the same server instance
- **No Scheduled Tasks**: No mechanism for recurring tasks
- **No Task Queue**: Tasks execute in the order they're received
- **Limited Scaling**: Cannot handle high volume of concurrent tasks

### 10.3 Post-MVP Task Processing

In future versions beyond MVP, the system will be upgraded to:

- **Celery**: For robust task queue system
- **Redis**: For task result storage and caching
- **RabbitMQ**: For reliable message broker
- **Scheduled Tasks**: For recurring operations
- **Distributed Processing**: For scalable task execution
