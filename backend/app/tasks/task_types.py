MVP Task Type Definitions and Dummy Implementations

This module defines task types and provides dummy implementations for the MVP version.
IMPORTANT: These are not actual Celery tasks. For the MVP, we are NOT using Celery, Redis, 
RabbitMQ or any related message broker infrastructure.

These are simple async functions that will be executed directly by the TaskManager
using FastAPI's background tasks feature.
